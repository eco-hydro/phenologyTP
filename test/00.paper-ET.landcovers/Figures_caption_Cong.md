Figure 1.Land use area ratio difference between 2008-2017 and 2004-2007 at each
0.5º × 0.5º grid cell for (a) forest, (b) shrubland, (c) grassland, (d) cropland and (e)
others vegetation types.


> Figure 1. Location of study area, validation catchments and meteorology sites. The
base map is generated from MODIS 2003 land use data, and regions I, II, III, and IV
represent for wind and sand conditions of the Inner Mongolia Plateau, northwest
desert condition, hilly and gully conditions of the Loess Plateau, and the Northeast
China Plain, respectively. The numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4 are for four validation
catchments: Huangpu, Wenjiachuan, Baijiachuan and Ganguyi, respectively. The four
flux tower sites include one forest site (CN-Cha) and three grassland sites (CN-Cng,
CN-Du2 and CN-Sw2).

Working on it
> Figure 2. Land use area ratio difference between 2008-2017 and 2004-2007 at each
0.5º × 0.5º grid cell for (a) forest, (b) shrubland, (c) grassland, (d) cropland and (e)
others vegetation types. The histogram summarizes the change of average ratio each
region. The ratio difference is estimated using Equations (2) and (3).

> Figure 3. Comparison between ETrs and ETwb in four catchments of (a) Baijiachuan,
(b) Ganguyi, (c) Wenjiachuan and (d) Huangpu. Their locations are shown in Figure 1.
The blue (orange) dash line indicates the linear trend in ETrs (ETwb). The R2 is the
coefficient of determination between ETrs and ETwb.

> Figure 4. Comparison between the 8-day simulated GPP (or ET) and the 8-day
observed GPP (or ET), and the yearly simulated and the yearly observed at four flux
tower sites. Their locations are shown in Figure 1.

Figure 5. The spatial pattern of (a) mean annual GPPrs and (b) mean annual ETrs,
averaged for 2004-2017, and LUCC-driven mean annual change in (c) GPPrs and (d)
ETrs from the two PML-V2 experiments (Dynamic – Static, in Eq. (1)).

Figure 6. The mean values of LUCC-driven change in (a) GPPrs, (b) ETrs and the
LUCC-driven volumetric change in (c) GPPrs, (d) ETrs in the four regions and five
land use types.

Figure 7. The LUCC-driven annual change in (a) GPPrs, (b) ETrs and (c) LAI
summarized in four regions. The change is calculated from the difference between the
simulations in each year minus the 2003 simulation.

Figure 8. Causality analysis by comparing (a) the LUCC-driven change in GPPrs
against LAI change, (b) the LUCC-driven change in ETrs against LAI change, (c) the
LUCC-driven trends in GPPrs against LAI trend, and (d) the LUCC-driven trends in
ETrs against LAI change. The change is calculated from the difference between
2004-2017 simulation average and 2003 simulation; the trend is estimated from the
simulation in the period of 2003 to 2017. For simplification, regions and land cover
types are distinguished using the acronyms of regions (I, II, III and IV) together with
the first letter of land cover types (i.e. Forest (F), Shrublands (S), Grasslands (G),
Croplands (C) and Others (O)).
